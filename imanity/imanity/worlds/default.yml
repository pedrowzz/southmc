# As you can see, there's tons to configure. Some options may impact gameplay, so use
# with caution, and make sure you know what each option does before configuring.

# In vanilla arrow, it always has a randomness value being applied to it trajectory.
# Which could potentially break some experience in terms of combat.
# You can increase it for more randomness or set to 0 to completely disable it.
arrowTrajectoryRandomness: 1.0

# In vanilla fishing hook, it always has a randomness value being applied to it trajectory.
# Which could potentially break some experience in terms of combat.

# Should we count any kind of entity for entity spawning limit?

# Should block operation be enabled?
# Block operation is a part of world ticking.
# It will randomly find tick-able blocks in each chunks to operate them.
# Such as leaves decay, fire spread, and grass spread etc are being worked in this section.
#  
# But at the same time it is very performance consuming.
# If your server doesn't need this vanilla behaviour, We highly suggest to disable it
# Especially for servers such as Practice, MiniGames... it is unnecessary.

# Which we think it's make sense to have it capped
maxAutoSaveChunksPerTick: 24

# Prevent queueing auto save works when the amount of current queue is more than specific amount
maxQueuedSizeAutoSave: 60

# The is the value to determine how long a chunk takes to tick may be higher then average in chunk analyzer
# Which might have the potential cause the server lag
# Unit is milli seconds
# (Chunk analyzer is a feature of Premium Plan, It's useless if you don't have the feature)
potentialLagChunkTickTime: 2.0

# This section allow you to configure the MobStacker settings
# MobStacker is a feature that allow you to stack mobs together

explosion:
